### Helloo! I'm Ivan also known as iardo over the online space.

I'm a Software Developer born and rooted in PanamÃ¡, enthusiastic about game development, 3D modeling/sculpting, shaders, and a bunch of other stuff âœ¨.

Always striving to be get better, I have a lot of interest in learning more about "low-level" concepts, like code optimization and compilers.

At the moment I'm learning C, Rust and <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>... sweet stuff.

Here's a photo of my split keyboard btw, is a `iris-rev6` pre-build by keebio.
